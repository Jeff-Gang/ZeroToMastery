Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter.


.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element element (only the elements nested inside the larger element will get styled)
element > element (all (2nd) elements that have 1st element as a parent)
element + element  (all elements that come directly after the 1st element - so the 1st element after and only the first - not subsequent)
:hover (p:hover, or a:hover)
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order

//

Only use *Float* with images
Make sure you *Clear* after for any properties that come after that you do not want to Float
