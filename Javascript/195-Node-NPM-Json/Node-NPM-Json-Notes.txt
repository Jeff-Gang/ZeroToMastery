// Node / NPM / Json notes //

Node uses v8 engine to run javascript outside of the browser

NPM = Node package manager

1. Install node first in order to use the command line to install NPM packages
2. To make sure you have Node and NPM installed, check the versions through the terminal window:
// node -v
// npm -v

3. When you start a new project, & you want to use NPM packages, then get in your project folder, 
open up Terminal, and type: 
npm init
which installs a "package.json" file.
