/* by reference vs. by value
primitive types are immutable. 
in order to change them, we need o remove the type and move it from memory and 
create something new. This is called pass by value.
var a = 5;
var b = a;

b++;

console.log(a)
console.log(b)
returns-->
5
6
<-- the "5" got copied from a to b.

Objects on the other hand, pass by reference.
What this means is that :*/
let obj1 = {name: 'yao', password: '123'};
let obj2 = obj1;

obj2.password = 'easypeasy'

console.log(obj1)
returns -->
